## GoalSight

The GoalSight Platform aims to leverage blockchain technology to facilitate transparent and decentralized approval processes for initiatives addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Background and Purpose

As global challenges persist, there's a growing need for innovative solutions to address SDGs. Web3 and blockchain offer opportunities for transparent and trustless governance, aligning with the principles of SDGs.

## Platform Overview
The platform allows users to submit problem insights related to SDGs, which are then reviewed and approved by the public or anyone who holds a token.
This tokens can be earned after contributing to a goal or insight.
Partnerships with organizations are integral to addressing approved problem insights effectively.

Two user roles exist: normal users who submit problem insights, and partners who collaborate on addressing approved insights. Each role has specific responsibilities and permissions.

Problem insights (Goals) submitted by all users undergo an approval workflow where the public (must have a token) assess their relevance and feasibility.

The platform incorporates a token reward system where users earn tokens for contributing on problem insights and participating in fundraising activities. These tokens incentivize engagement and contribution.

Partnerships with organizations, such as hospitals or NGOs, are essential for addressing approved problem insights effectively. Partners undergo an approval process to ensure alignment with project goals. Partners will be assessed by the anyone who has a token and has earned enough reputation on the platform (3 Reputations). Reputation can be earned after contributing more than 200 USD to a Goal or Problem Insight, or by Creating a problem insight. Partners can also earn reputation after the goal or problem insight has been completed.

## Smart Contract Implementation
Smart contracts automate DAO processes within the platform, such as approval decisions and token distribution. They ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in governance.
